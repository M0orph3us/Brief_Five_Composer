# Create a responsive site

This project is carried out as part of the Application Developer Designer training at [Simplon Grenoble](https://simplon.co/).

## Context

The objective of this project is to create a site to allow volunteers to register to participate in events according to their choice of region as well as the positions they want to occupy during their missions.
They can see the events assigned to them on their profile page.

The administrator can create and assign events to volunteers.
On his adminboard he can see all upcoming events as well as the list of volunteers he has assigned to them.
